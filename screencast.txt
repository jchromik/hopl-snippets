The screencasts shows two different implementations for finding primes in a range of integers.
On the left hand side, the sequential implementation (seqprimes) is used.
On the right hand side, the parallel implementation (parprimes) is used. 

Firstly, the Erlang shell is started within both unix shells using the command "erl".
Secondly, the modules for finding primes are loaded using the Erlang shell commands "c(seqprimes)" and "c(parprimes)".
Finally, the computations is started. The algorithms have to find all prime numbers between 1 and 100000 (first and second argument of the funtion call).
For the parallel implementation, the third argument states how many actors should be used (11 in this case).

The screencast shows that the parallel implementation is about two times faster than the sequential one.
The computation took place on a quad-core CPU.
